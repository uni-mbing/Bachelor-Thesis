As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration and proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is flow associated with the nascent network, subsequent growth evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix, and perfusion-related hemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this article, we first present a review of previous theoretical and computational models of angiogenesis and then indicate how recent developments in flow models are providing insight into antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic drug treatment of solid tumors.},

And each of these cells is governed by the genetic information encoded in the DNA present in the cells' nuclei. Although the nucleotide sequence of DNA is well checked and maintained throughout one's life, mutations still occur that in certain instances cause diseases, cancer being one of them. The failure of the intricate genetic system that balances cell birth and cell death causes cancer. Cancer cells are clonal as a single common ancestral cell gradually accumulates mutation to form a tumor that over time develops malignancy. Growth factors are important components of tumor microenvironment that provide heterogeneity and autonomy to cancer cells, the properties that normal cells lack. Not only spontaneous mutations and genetic predisposition but also lifestyle, to a great extent, contributes to carcinogenesis. Tobacco smoke, UV rays, X-rays, agents that attack DNA, and change in its chemical structure are potential carcinogens. Viruses too can cause carcinogenesis. Whatever be the causes, they all affect the fundamental aspects of cellular function, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Thus, correct and effective management of this fatal disease is only possible if the underlying biological complicacies are well understood.",

  abstract = "Cancer is a complex disease that starts with mutations of key
              genes in one cell or a small group of cells at a primary site in
              the body. If these cancer cells continue to grow successfully
              and, at some later stage, invade the surrounding tissue and
              acquire a vascular network, they can spread to distant secondary
              sites in the body. This process, known as metastatic spread, is
              responsible for around 90\% of deaths from cancer and is one of
              the so-called hallmarks of cancer. To shed light on the
              metastatic process, we present a mathematical modelling framework
              that captures for the first time the interconnected processes of
              invasion and metastatic spread of individual cancer cells in a
              spatially explicit manner-a multigrid, hybrid, individual-based
              approach. This framework accounts for the spatiotemporal
              evolution of mesenchymal- and epithelial-like cancer cells,
              membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and the
              diffusible matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and for their
              interactions with the extracellular matrix. Using computational
              simulations, we demonstrate that our model captures all the key
              steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, i.e. invasion by both
              heterogeneous cancer cell clusters and by single mesenchymal-like
              cancer cells; intravasation of these clusters and single cells
              both via active mechanisms mediated by matrix-degrading enzymes
              (MDEs) and via passive shedding; circulation of cancer cell
              clusters and single cancer cells in the vasculature with the
              associated risk of cell death and disaggregation of clusters;
              extravasation of clusters and single cells; and metastatic growth
              at distant secondary sites in the body. By faithfully reproducing
              experimental results, our simulations support the evidence-based
              hypothesis that the membrane-bound MT1-MMP is the main driver of
              invasive spread rather than diffusible MDEs such as MMP-2.",

abstract={This paper deals with a chemotaxis-haptotaxis model of cancer invasion of tissue (extracellular matrix (ECM)). The model consists of a parabolic chemotaxis-haptotaxis PDE describing the evolution of cancer cell density, a parabolic PDE governing the evolution of matrix degrading enzyme concentration, and an ODE reflecting the degradation of ECM. Following a recent approach proposed by Szymańska, Morales-Rodrigo, Lachowicz, and Chaplain [Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 19 (2009), pp. 257–281], we assume that the migration of cancer cells through ECM is more like movement in a porous medium. Accordingly, we consider the self-diffusion coefficient \$D(u)\$ of cancer cells to be a nonlinear function generalizing the prototype \$D(u)=(u+1)^{m-1}\$ for some \$m\geq1\$. Under the assumption that either \$n\leq8\$ and \$m>(2n^2+4n-4)/(n^2+4n)\$, or \$n\geq9\$ and \$m>(2n^2+3n+2-\sqrt{8n(n+1)})/(n^2+2n)\$ (where n denotes the space dimension), and in the presence of logistic dampening of cancer cell densities, the global existence of a unique classical solution to the model is proved by developing some \$L^p\$-estimate techniques that appear to be new in the context of chemotaxis-haptotaxis systems. }

	abstract = {Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model.We analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed for the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and interanimal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 843 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the Exponential, Logistic and Gompertz. The Exponential and {\textendash} more notably {\textendash} Logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R2 \&gt; 0.96 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a novel reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter. Leveraging the population approach using bayesian inference, we estimated the time of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy was 12.1\% versus 74.1\% and mean precision was 15.2 days versus 186 days, for the breast cancer cell line.These results offer promising clinical perspectives for the personalized prediction of tumor age from limited data at diagnosis. In turn, such predictions could be helpful for assessing the extent of invisible metastasis at the time of diagnosis.Author summary Mathematical models for tumor growth kinetics have been widely used since several decades but mostly fitted to individual or average growth curves. Here we compared three classical models (Exponential, Logistic and Gompertz) using a population approach, which accounts for inter-animal variability. The Exponential and the Logistic models failed to fit the experimental data while the Gompertz model showed excellent descriptive power. Moreover, the strong correlation between the two parameters of the Gompertz equation motivated a simplification of the model, the reduced Gompertz model, with a single individual parameter and equal descriptive power. Combining the mixed-effects approach with Bayesian inference, we predicted the age of individual tumors with only few late measurements. Thanks to its simplicity, the reduced Gompertz model showed superior predictive power. Although our method remains to be extended to clinical data, these results are promising for the personalized estimation of the age of a tumor from limited measurements at diagnosis. Such predictions could contribute to the development of computational models for metastasis.},

  abstract  = "Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing
               vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed
               in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts
               then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell
               migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure.
               Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits
               further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the
               process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound
               healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In
               this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical
               models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout
               network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic
               factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take

               interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule

               understanding of anticancer treatment resistance. A better
               characterization of cancer evolution and subsequent use of this
               knowledge for personalized treatment would increase the chance
               to overcome cancer treatment resistance. Model-based approaches
               may help achieve this goal. In this review, we comprehensively
               summarized mathematical models of tumor dynamics for solid
               tumors and of drug resistance evolution. Models displayed by
               ordinary differential equations, algebraic equations, and
               partial differential equations for characterizing tumor burden
               dynamics are introduced and discussed. As for tumor resistance
               evolution, stochastic and deterministic models are introduced
               and discussed. The results may facilitate a novel model-based
               analysis on anticancer treatment response and the occurrence of
               resistance, which incorporates both tumor dynamics and
               resistance evolution. The opportunities of a model-based
               approach as discussed in this review can be of great benefit for
               future optimizing and personalizing anticancer treatment.",

abstract={This paper is devoted to the study of a time-discrete scheme and its corresponding fully discretization approximating a d-dimensional chemotaxis model describing tumor invasion, d ≤{\thinspace}3. This model describes the chemotactic attraction experienced by the tumor cells and induced by a so-called active extracellular matrix, which is a chemical signal produced by a biological reaction between the extracellular matrix and a matrix-degrading enzyme. In order to construct the numerical approximations and to control the chemo-attraction term in the tumor cells equation, we introduce an equivalent model with a new variable given by the gradient of the active extracellular matrix and use an inductive strategy. Then, we consider a first-order and non-linear time-discrete scheme which is mass-conservative and possesses the property of positivity for all the biological variables. After, we study the corresponding fully discrete finite element with ``mass-lumping'' approximation proving well-posedness, mass-conservation and the non-negativity of the extracellular matrix, the degrading enzyme, and the active extracellular matrix. In addition, we obtain uniform strong estimates required in the convergence analysis, and we prove optimal error estimates and convergence towards regular solutions. Finally, we provide some numerical results in agreement with our theoretical analysis with respect to the positivity and the error estimates.},

abstract = {The parallel space-time adaptivity techniques for solving a cancer invasion model are investigated in the present work. Mathematically, the model comprises three coupled reaction-diffusion equations that characterize the cancer cell density evolution, the matrix-degrading enzymes and the extracellular matrix. The numerical realization demands fine resolutions both in spatial and temporal due to the incorporation of the nonlinear density-dependent diffusion and haptotaxis effect. We investigate this challenging problem by combining adaptive space-time discretization techniques with a dynamic load balancing to reduce the computational cost without sacrificing the accuracy of the numerical solutions. For the spatial discretization, the multilevel finite element method is used, and for temporal discretization, the implicit Euler method, and the linearly implicit Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time step are used. A non-overlapping domain decomposition method is considered for the dynamic decomposition of the computational mesh. Furthermore, the mathematical analysis for the existence of the fully discretized system is presented. The numerical results show density-dependent diffusion and haptotaxis effects on tumor growth and invasion. We illustrate the superiority of the dynamic space and time adaptivity in a parallel setting using several test cases.}

abstract = {Solid tumours grow through two distinct phases: the avascular and the
vascular phase. During the avascular growth phase, the size of the
solid tumour is restricted largely by a diffusion-limited nutrient
supply and the solid tumour remains localised and grows to a maximum
of a few millimetres in diameter. However, during the vascular growth
stage the process of cancer invasion of peritumoral tissue can and
does take place. A crucial component of tissue invasion is the
over-expression by the cancer cells of proteolytic enzyme
activity, such as the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). uPA itself initiates the activation
of an enzymatic cascade that primarily involves the activation of
plasminogen and subsequently its matrix degrading protein
plasmin. Degradation of the matrix then enables the cancer cells to
migrate through the tissue and subsequently to spread to secondary
sites in the body.
<br>    
In this paper we consider a relatively simple mathematical model of
cancer cell invasion of tissue (extracellular matrix) which focuses on
the role of a generic matrix degrading enzyme such as uPA. The model
consists of a system of reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential
equations describing the interactions between cancer cells, the matrix
degrading enzyme and the host tissue. The results obtained from
numerical computations carried out on the model equations produce
dynamic, heterogeneous spatio-temporal solutions and demonstrate the
ability of a rather simple model to produce complicated dynamics, all
of which are associated with tumour heterogeneity and cancer cell
progression and invasion.}
