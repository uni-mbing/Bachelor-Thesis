	abstract = {In this paper we present two types of mathematical model which describe the invasion of host tissue by tumour cells. In the models, we focus on three key variables implicated in the invasion process, namely, tumour cells, host tissue (extracellular matrix) and matrix-degradative enzymes associated with the tumour cells. The first model focusses on the macro-scale structure (cell population level) and considers the tumour as a single mass. The mathematical model consists of a system of partial differential equations describing the production and/or activation of degradative enzymes by the tumour cells, the degradation of the matrix and the migratory response of the tumour cells. Numerical simulations are presented in one and two space dimensions and compared qualitatively with experimental and clinical observations. The second type of model focusses on the micro-scale (individual cell) level and uses a discrete technique developed in previous models of angiogenesis. This technique enables one to model migration and invasion at the level of individual cells and hence it is possible to examine the implications of metastatic spread. Finally, the results of the models are compared with actual clinical observations and the implications of the model for improved surgical treatment of patients are considered.},

	abstract = {Angiogenesis, the growth of a network of blood vessels, is a crucial component of solid tumor growth, linking the relatively harmless avascular and the potentially fatal vascular growth phases of the tumor. As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration and proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is flow associated with the nascent network, subsequent growth evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix, and perfusion-related hemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this article, we first present a review of previous theoretical and computational models of angiogenesis and then indicate how recent developments in flow models are providing insight into antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic drug treatment of solid tumors.},

And each of these cells is governed by the genetic information encoded in the DNA present in the cells' nuclei. Although the nucleotide sequence of DNA is well checked and maintained throughout one's life, mutations still occur that in certain instances cause diseases, cancer being one of them. The failure of the intricate genetic system that balances cell birth and cell death causes cancer. Cancer cells are clonal as a single common ancestral cell gradually accumulates mutation to form a tumor that over time develops malignancy. Growth factors are important components of tumor microenvironment that provide heterogeneity and autonomy to cancer cells, the properties that normal cells lack. Not only spontaneous mutations and genetic predisposition but also lifestyle, to a great extent, contributes to carcinogenesis. Tobacco smoke, UV rays, X-rays, agents that attack DNA, and change in its chemical structure are potential carcinogens. Viruses too can cause carcinogenesis. Whatever be the causes, they all affect the fundamental aspects of cellular function, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Thus, correct and effective management of this fatal disease is only possible if the underlying biological complicacies are well understood.",

              heterogeneity, and cancer evolution has improved the

              characterization of cancer evolution and subsequent use of this
              knowledge for personalized treatment would increase the chance to
              overcome cancer treatment resistance. Model-based approaches may
              help achieve this goal. In this review, we comprehensively
              summarized mathematical models of tumor dynamics for solid tumors
              and of drug resistance evolution. Models displayed by ordinary
              differential equations, algebraic equations, and partial
              differential equations for characterizing tumor burden dynamics
              are introduced and discussed. As for tumor resistance evolution,
              stochastic and deterministic models are introduced and discussed.
              The results may facilitate a novel model-based analysis on
              anticancer treatment response and the occurrence of resistance,
              which incorporates both tumor dynamics and resistance evolution.
              The opportunities of a model-based approach as discussed in this

  abstract = "Cancer is a complex disease that starts with mutations of key
              genes in one cell or a small group of cells at a primary site in
              the body. If these cancer cells continue to grow successfully
              and, at some later stage, invade the surrounding tissue and
              acquire a vascular network, they can spread to distant secondary
              sites in the body. This process, known as metastatic spread, is
              responsible for around 90\% of deaths from cancer and is one of
              the so-called hallmarks of cancer. To shed light on the
              metastatic process, we present a mathematical modelling framework
              that captures for the first time the interconnected processes of
              invasion and metastatic spread of individual cancer cells in a
              spatially explicit manner-a multigrid, hybrid, individual-based
              approach. This framework accounts for the spatiotemporal
              evolution of mesenchymal- and epithelial-like cancer cells,
              membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and the
              diffusible matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and for their
              interactions with the extracellular matrix. Using computational
              simulations, we demonstrate that our model captures all the key
              steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, i.e. invasion by both
              heterogeneous cancer cell clusters and by single mesenchymal-like
              cancer cells; intravasation of these clusters and single cells
              both via active mechanisms mediated by matrix-degrading enzymes
              (MDEs) and via passive shedding; circulation of cancer cell
              clusters and single cancer cells in the vasculature with the
              associated risk of cell death and disaggregation of clusters;
              extravasation of clusters and single cells; and metastatic growth
              at distant secondary sites in the body. By faithfully reproducing
              experimental results, our simulations support the evidence-based
              hypothesis that the membrane-bound MT1-MMP is the main driver of
              invasive spread rather than diffusible MDEs such as MMP-2.",
