            This paper presents a robust digital pipeline from CT images to the simulation of contact between multiple bodies. The proposed strategy relies on a recently developed immersed finite element algorithm that is capable of simulating unilateral contact between solids without meshing (Claus and Kerfriden in Int J Numer Methods Eng 113(6):938–966, 2018). It was shown that such an approach reduces the difficulties associated with the digital flow of information from analytically defined geometries to mechanical simulations. We now propose to extend our approach to include geometries, which are not defined mathematically but instead are obtained from images, and encoded in 3D arrays of voxels. This paper introduces two novel elements. Firstly, we reformulate our contact algorithm into an extension of an augmented Lagrangian CutFEM algorithm. Secondly, we develop an efficient algorithm to convert the surface data generated by standard segmentation tools used in medical imaging into level-set functions. These two elements give rise to a robust digital pipeline with minimum user intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm on a hip joint geometry with contact between the femur and the hip bone.},

However, cancers exhibit an inherent evolving heterogeneity that requires an individual approach based on rigorous and precise predictions of cancer growth and treatment response. To this end, we advocate the use of quantitative in vivo imaging data to calibrate mathematical models for the personalized forecasting of tumor development. In this chapter, we summarize the main data types available from both common and emerging in vivo medical imaging technologies, and how these data can be used to obtain patient-specific parameters for common mathematical models of cancer. We then outline computational methods designed to solve these models, thereby enabling their use for producing personalized tumor forecasts in silico, which, ultimately, can be used to not only predict response, but also optimize treatment. Finally, we discuss the main barriers to making the above paradigm a clinical reality.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          It has long been noted that the cell arrangements in epithelia, regardless of their origin, exhibit some striking regularities: first, the average number of cell neighbours at the apical side is (close to) six. Second, the average apical cell area is linearly related to the number of neighbours, such that cells with larger apical area have on average more neighbours, a relation termed Lewis’ law. Third, Aboav-Weaire’s (AW) law relates the number of neighbours that a cell has to that of its direct neighbours. While the first rule can be explained with topological constraints in contiguous polygonal lattices, and the second rule (Lewis’ law) with the minimisation of the lateral contact surface energy, the driving forces behind the AW law have remained elusive. We now show that also the AW law emerges to minimise the lateral contact surface energy in polygonal lattices by driving cells to the most regular polygonal shape, but while Lewis’ law regulates the side lengths, the AW law controls the angles. We conclude that global apical epithelial organization is the result of energy minimisation under topological constraints.},

	abstract = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer's ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

In the context of surgery simulation or real-time intraoperative registration this method allows for adapting a finite element model during the operation in the presence of cutting or resection.
We outline a formulation of the eXtended finite element method (X-FEM) for elastic solids and present an approach for modeling arbitrary cuts by means of finite elements on tetrahedral grids. For this purpose, completely cut elements are enriched with the shifted Heaviside function and partially cut elements are enriched with so-called asymptotic crack tip functions. In this context we show how to handle the geometry of partial cuts and how the necessary local coordinate system based on polar coordinates is constructed. Finally, we present a flexible implementation of the approach.
A numerical validation shows that the approach can handle complex cuts through low resolution geometries. Furthermore, a convergence analysis reveals that the approach is superior to standard remeshing techniques in terms of accuracy per degrees of freedom.

This cross–talk involves extracellular matrix molecules, cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion molecules as well as paracrine factors and their receptors. The cellular and molecular unit is additionally regulated by hormonal, immune and neural inputs. Such integrated cell interactions are involved in pattern formation, in proximodistal regionalization, in maintenance of a gradient of epithelial proliferation and differentiation, and in epithelial cell migration. We focus predominantly on two aspects of these integrated interactions in this paper: (i) the role of basement membrane molecules, namely laminins, in the developmental and spatial epithelial behaviour; and (ii) the importance of the mesenchymal cell compartment in these processes.},

	abstract = {Development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract depends on reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal cell signaling. Here, we demonstrate a role for platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) and its receptor, PDGFR-(alpha), in this process. Mice lacking PDGF-A or PDGFR-(alpha) were found to develop an abnormal GI mucosal lining, including fewer and misshapen villi and loss of pericryptal mesenchyme. Onset of villus morphogenesis correlated with the formation of clusters of PDGFR-(alpha) positive cells, ‘villus clusters’, which remained located at the tip of the mesenchymal core of the growing villus. Lack of PDGF-A or PDGFR-(alpha) resulted in progressive depletion of PDGFR-(alpha) positive mesenchymal cells, the formation of fewer villus clusters, and premature expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA) in the villus mesenchyme. We found that the villus clusters were postmitotic, expressed BMP-2 and BMP-4, and that their formation correlated with downregulated DNA synthesis in adjacent intestinal epithelium. We propose a model in which villus morphogenesis is initiated as a result of aggregation of PDGFR-(α) positive cells into cell clusters that subsequently function as mesenchymal centers of signaling to the epithelium. The role of PDGF-A seems to be to secure renewal of PDGFR-(alpha) positive cells when they are consumed in the initial rounds of cluster formation.},

	abstract = {Metastasis can involve repeated cycles of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Cells can also undergo partial transitions to attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that allows the migration of adhering cells to form a cluster of circulating tumour cells. These clusters can be apoptosis-resistant and possess an increased metastatic propensity as compared to the cells that undergo a complete EMT (mesenchymal cells). Hence, identifying the key players that can regulate the formation and maintenance of such clusters may inform anti-metastasis strategies. Here, we devise a mechanism-based theoretical model that links cell–cell communication via Notch-Delta-Jagged signalling with the regulation of EMT. We demonstrate that while both Notch-Delta and Notch-Jagged signalling can induce EMT in a population of cells, only Jagged-dominated Notch signalling, but not Delta-dominated signalling, can lead to the formation of clusters containing hybrid E/M cells. Our results offer possible mechanistic insights into the role of Jagged in tumour progression, and offer a framework to investigate the effects of other microenvironmental signals during metastasis.},

Here, we use a general model of periodic patterning to show that different types of mechanism (molecular, cellular, mechanical) can generate qualitatively similar final patterns. Observation of final patterns is therefore not sufficient to favour one mechanism over others. However, we propose that a mathematical approach can help to guide the design of experiments that can distinguish between different mechanisms, and illustrate the potential value of this approach with specific biological examples.},

              The reaction-diffusion (Turing) model is a theoretical model used to explain self-regulated pattern formation in biology. Although many biologists have heard of this model, a better understanding of the concept would aid its application to many research projects and developmental principles.

              ) now review the reaction-diffusion model. Despite the associated mathematics, the basic idea of the Turing model is relatively easy to understand and relates to morphogen gradients. In addition, user-friendly software makes it easy to understand how a whole variety of patterns can be produced by this simple mechanism.
            
          , 
            The Turing, or reaction-diffusion (RD), model is one of the best-known theoretical models used to explain self-regulated pattern formation in the developing animal embryo. Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

	abstract = {Embryogenesis offers a real laboratory for pattern formation, buckling, and postbuckling induced by growth of soft tissues. Each part of our body is structured in multiple adjacent layers: the skin, the brain, and the interior of organs. Each layer has a complex biological composition presenting different elasticity. Generated during fetal life, these layers will experience growth and remodeling in the early postfertilization stages. Here, we focus on a herringbone pattern occurring in fetal intestinal tissues. Common to many mammalians, this instability is a precursor of the villi, finger-like projections into the lumen. For avians (chicks’ and turkeys’ embryos), it has been shown that, a few days after fertilization, the mucosal epithelium of the duodenum is smooth, and then folds emerge, which present 2 d later a pronounced zigzag instability. Many debates and biological studies are devoted to this specific morphology, which regulates the cell renewal in the intestine. After reviewing experimental results about duodenum morphogenesis, we show that a model based on simplified hypothesis for the growth of the mesenchyme can explain buckling and postbuckling instabilities. Being completely analytical, it is based on biaxial compressive stresses due to differential growth between layers and it predicts quantitatively the morphological changes. The growth anisotropy increasing with time, the competition between folds and zigzags, is proved to occur as a secondary instability. The model is compared with available experimental data on chick’s duodenum and can be applied to other intestinal tissues, the zigzag being a common and spectacular microstructural pattern of intestine embryogenesis.},

            Growth and remodeling in arterial tissue have attracted considerable attention over the last decade. Mathematical models have been proposed, and computational studies with these have helped to understand the role of the different model parameters. So far it remains, however, poorly understood how much of the model output variability can be attributed to the individual input parameters and their interactions. To clarify this, we propose herein a global sensitivity analysis, based on Sobol indices, for a homogenized constrained mixture model of aortic growth and remodeling. In two representative examples, we found that 54–80\% of the long term output variability resulted from only three model parameters. In our study, the two most influential parameters were the one characterizing the ability of the tissue to increase collagen production under increased stress and the one characterizing the collagen half-life time. The third most influential parameter was the one characterizing the strain-stiffening of collagen under large deformation. Our results suggest that in future computational studies it may - at least in scenarios similar to the ones studied herein - suffice to use population average values for the other parameters. Moreover, our results suggest that developing methods to measure the said three most influential parameters may be an important step towards reliable patient-specific predictions of the enlargement of abdominal aortic aneurysms in clinical practice.},

Mit der fünften Auflage erfolgte eine weitere Abrundung bei den Themen, deren Bedeutung in den letzten Jahren gewachsen ist. Mit der Theorie der a posteriori Fehlerschätzer wird a priori Information über den Diskretisierungsfehler gewonnen, die in der klassischen Theorie noch nicht hergeleitet wurden und die - schärfer als sonst -eine Eigenart von a posteriori Schätzern beleuchtet.

            This work explores a continuum-mechanical model for a body simultaneously undergoing finite deformation and surface growth/resorption. This is accomplished by defining the kinematics as well as the set of material points that constitute the domain of a physical body at a given time in terms of an evolving reference configuration. The implications of spatial and temporal discretization are discussed, and an extension of the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian finite element method is proposed to enforce the resulting balance laws on the grown/resorbed body in two spatial dimensions. Representative numerical examples are presented to highlight the predictive capabilities of the model and the numerical properties of the proposed solution method.},

              BACKGROUND
              Numerous studies have reported declines in semen quality and other markers of male reproductive health. Our previous meta-analysis reported a significant decrease in sperm concentration (SC) and total sperm count (TSC) among men from North America–Europe–Australia (NEA) based on studies published during 1981–2013. At that time, there were too few studies with data from South/Central America–Asia–Africa (SAA) to reliably estimate trends among men from these continents.
            
            
              OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE
              The aim of this study was to examine trends in sperm count among men from all continents. The broader implications of a global decline in sperm count, the knowledge gaps left unfilled by our prior analysis and the controversies surrounding this issue warranted an up-to-date meta-analysis.
            
            
              SEARCH METHODS
              We searched PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify studies of human SC and TSC published during 2014–2019. After review of 2936 abstracts and 868 full articles, 44 estimates of SC and TSC from 38 studies met the protocol criteria. Data were extracted on semen parameters (SC, TSC, semen volume), collection year and covariates. Combining these new data with data from our previous meta-analysis, the current meta-analysis includes results from 223 studies, yielding 288 estimates based on semen samples collected 1973–2018. Slopes of SC and TSC were estimated as functions of sample collection year using simple linear regression as well as weighted meta-regression. The latter models were adjusted for predetermined covariates and examined for modification by fertility status (unselected by fertility versus fertile), and by two groups of continents: NEA and SAA. These analyses were repeated for data collected post-2000. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine assumptions, including linearity.
            
            
              OUTCOMES
              Overall, SC declined appreciably between 1973 and 2018 (slope in the simple linear model: –0.87 million/ml/year, 95\% CI: –0.89 to –0.86; P \&lt; 0.001). In an adjusted meta-regression model, which included two interaction terms [time × fertility group (P = 0.012) and time × continents (P = 0.058)], declines were seen among unselected men from NEA (–1.27; –1.78 to –0.77; P \&lt; 0.001) and unselected men from SAA (–0.65; –1.29 to –0.01; P = 0.045) and fertile men from NEA (–0.50; –1.00 to –0.01; P = 0.046). Among unselected men from all continents, the mean SC declined by 51.6\% between 1973 and 2018 (–1.17: –1.66 to –0.68; P \&lt; 0.001). The slope for SC among unselected men was steeper in a model restricted to post-2000 data (–1.73: –3.23 to –0.24; P = 0.024) and the percent decline per year doubled, increasing from 1.16\% post-1972 to 2.64\% post-2000. Results were similar for TSC, with a 62.3\% overall decline among unselected men (–4.70 million/year; –6.56 to –2.83; P \&lt; 0.001) in the adjusted meta-regression model. All results changed only minimally in multiple sensitivity analyses.
            
            
              WIDER IMPLICATIONS
              This analysis is the first to report a decline in sperm count among unselected men from South/Central America–Asia–Africa, in contrast to our previous meta-analysis that was underpowered to examine those continents. Furthermore, data suggest that this world-wide decline is continuing in the 21st century at an accelerated pace. Research on the causes of this continuing decline and actions to prevent further disruption of male reproductive health are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            In the current ice-sheet models calving of ice shelves is based on phenomenological approaches. To obtain physics-based calving criteria, a viscoelastic Maxwell model is required accounting for short-term elastic and long-term viscous deformation. On timescales of months to years between calving events, as well as on long timescales with several subsequent iceberg break-offs, deformations are no longer small and linearized strain measures cannot be used. We present a finite deformation framework of viscoelasticity and extend this model by a nonlinear Glen-type viscosity. A finite element implementation is used to compute stress and strain states in the vicinity of the ice-shelf calving front. Stress and strain maxima of small (linearized strain measure) and finite strain formulations differ by {\textasciitilde} 5\% after 1 and by {\textasciitilde} 30\% after 10 years, respectively. A finite deformation formulation reaches a critical stress or strain faster, thus calving rates will be higher, despite the fact that the exact critical values are not known. Nonlinear viscosity of Glen-type leads to higher stress values. The Maxwell material model formulation for finite deformations presented here can also be applied to other glaciological problems, for example, tidal forcing at grounding lines or closure of englacial and subglacial melt channels.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental tenets of oncology is that tumors arise from
 stem cells. In the colon, stem cells are thought to reside at the base
 of crypts. In the early stages of tumorigenesis, however, dysplastic
 cells are routinely found at the luminal surface of the crypts whereas
 the cells at the bases of these same crypts appear morphologically
 normal. To understand this discrepancy, we evaluated the molecular
 characteristics of cells isolated from the bases and orifices of the
 same crypts in small colorectal adenomas. We found that the dysplastic
 cells at the tops of the crypts often exhibited genetic alterations of
 adenomatous polyposis coli (
              APC
              ) and
 neoplasia-associated patterns of gene expression. In contrast, cells
 located at the base of these same crypts did not contain such
 alterations and were not clonally related to the contiguous transformed
 cells above them. These results imply that development of adenomatous
 polyps proceeds through a top-down mechanism. Genetically altered cells
 in the superficial portions of the mucosae spread laterally and
 downward to form new crypts that first connect to preexisting normal
 crypts and eventually replace them.},

A homotopy is studied that takes a Schnakenberg-like glycolysis model to the Gray–Scott model. Numerical continuation is used to understand the complete sequence of transitions to two-parameter bifurcation diagrams within the localized pattern parameter regime as the homotopy parameter varies. Several distinct codimension-two bifurcations are discovered including cusp and quadruple zero points for homogeneous steady states, a degenerate heteroclinic connection and a change in connectedness of the homoclinic snaking structure. The analysis is repeated for the Gierer–Meinhardt system, which lies outside the canonical framework. Similar transitions are found under homotopy between bifurcation diagrams for the case where there is a constant feed in the active field, to it being in the inactive field. Wider implications of the results are discussed for other pattern-formation systems arising as models of natural phenomena.

	abstract = {Abstract. Molecules containing two rare isotopes (e.g., 13C18O16O in CO2), called clumped isotopes, in atmospheric CO2 are powerful tools to provide an alternative way to independently constrain the sources of CO2 in the atmosphere because of their unique physical and chemical properties. We presented clumped isotope data (Δ47) in near-surface atmospheric CO2 from urban, suburban, ocean, coast, high mountain ( ∼  3.2 km a.s.l.) and forest in Taiwan and its vicinity. The primary goal of the study was to use the unique Δ47 signature in atmospheric CO2 to show the extents of its deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium due to different processes such as photosynthesis, respiration and local anthropogenic emissions, which the commonly used tracers such as δ13C and δ18O cannot provide. We also explored the potential of Δ47 to identify/quantify the contribution of CO2 from various sources. Atmospheric CO2 over ocean was found to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding surface sea water. Respired CO2 was also in close thermodynamic equilibrium at ambient air temperature. In contrast, photosynthetic activity result in significant deviation in Δ47 values from that expected thermodynamically. The disequilibrium could be a consequence of kinetic effects associated with the diffusion of CO2 in and out of the leaf stomata. We observed that δ18O and Δ47 do not vary similarly when photosynthesis was involved unlike simple water–CO2 exchange. Additionally we obtained Δ47 values of car exhaust CO2 that were significantly lower than the atmospheric CO2 but higher than that expected at the combustion temperature. In urban and suburban regions, the Δ47 values were found to be lower than the thermodynamic equilibrium values at the ambient temperature, suggesting contributions from local combustion emission.},

	abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a molecular subtype of breast malignancy with a poor clinical prognosis. There is growing evidence that some chemotherapeutic agents induce an adaptive anti-tumor immune response. This reaction has been proposed to maintain the equilibrium phase of the immunoediting process and to control tumor growth by immunological cancer dormancy. We recently reported a model of immunological breast cancer dormancy based on the murine 4T1 TNBC model. Treatment of 4T1 cells in vitro with high-dose chemotherapy activated the type I interferon (type I IFN) signaling pathway, causing a switch from immunosuppressive to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-dependent immune response in vivo, resulting in sustained dormancy. Here, we developed a deterministic mathematical model based on the assumption that two cell subpopulations exist within the treated tumor: one population with high type I IFN signaling and immunogenicity and lower growth rate; the other population with low type I IFN signaling and immunogenicity and higher growth rate. The model reproduced cancer dormancy, elimination, and immune-escape in agreement with our previously reported experimental data. It predicted that the injection of dormant tumor cells with active type I IFN signaling results in complete growth control of the aggressive parental cancer cells injected at a later time point, but also of an already established aggressive tumor. Taken together, our results indicate that a dormant cell population can suppress the growth of an aggressive counterpart by eliciting a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-dependent immune response.},

	abstract = {Cancer dormancy, a state in which cancer cells persist in a host without significant growth, is a natural forestallment of progression to manifest disease and is thus of great clinical interest. Experimental work in mice suggests that in immune-induced dormancy, the longer a cancer remains dormant in a host, the more resistant the cancer cells become to cytotoxic T-cell-mediated killing. In this work, mathematical models are used to analyse the possible causative mechanisms of cancer escape from immune-induced dormancy. Using a data-driven approach, both decaying efficacy in immune predation and immune recruitment are analysed with results suggesting that decline in recruitment is a stronger determinant of escape than increased resistance to predation. Using a mechanistic approach, the existence of an immune-resistant cancer cell subpopulation is considered, and the effects on cancer dormancy and potential immunoediting mechanisms of cancer escape are analysed and discussed. The immunoediting mechanism assumes that the immune system selectively prunes the cancer of immune-sensitive cells, which is shown to cause an initially heterogeneous population to become a more homogeneous, and more resistant, population. The fact that this selection may result in the appearance of decreasing efficacy in T-cell cytotoxic effect with time in dormancy is also demonstrated. This work suggests that through actions that temporarily delay cancer growth through the targeted removal of immune-sensitive subpopulations, the immune response may actually progress the cancer to a more aggressive state.},

While it inhibits cell proliferation, it also increases cell motility and decreases cell–cell adhesion. Coupling mathematical modelling and experiments, we investigate the growth and motility of oncogene-expressing human mammary epithelial cells under exposure to TGF-β.

The most important hallmark of this type of tumour is its invasive behaviour, characterized by a markedly phenotypic plasticity, infiltrative tumour morphologies and the ability of malignant progression from low- to high-grade tumour types. Indeed, the widespread infiltration of healthy brain tissue by glioma cells is largely responsible for poor prognosis and the difficulty of finding curative therapies. Meanwhile, mathematical models have been established to analyse potential mechanisms of glioma invasion. In this review, we start with a brief introduction to current biological knowledge about glioma invasion, and then critically review and highlight future challenges for mathematical models of glioma invasion.},

As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration and proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is flow associated with the nascent network, subsequent growth evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix, and perfusion-related hemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this article, we first present a review of previous theoretical and computational models of angiogenesis and then indicate how recent developments in flow models are providing insight into antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic drug treatment of solid tumors.},

	abstract = {The Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov model, also known as the Fisher–KPP model, supports travelling wave solutions that are successfully used to model numerous invasive phenomena with applications in biology, ecology and combustion theory. However, there are certain phenomena that the Fisher–KPP model cannot replicate, such as the extinction of invasive populations. The Fisher–Stefan model is an adaptation of the Fisher–KPP model to include a moving boundary whose evolution is governed by a Stefan condition. The Fisher–Stefan model also supports travelling wave solutions; however, a key additional feature of the Fisher–Stefan model is that it is able to simulate population extinction, giving rise to a
              spreading–extinction dichotomy
              . In this work, we revisit travelling wave solutions of the Fisher–KPP model and show that these results provide new insight into travelling wave solutions of the Fisher–Stefan model and the spreading–extinction dichotomy. Using a combination of phase plane analysis, perturbation analysis and linearization, we establish a concrete relationship between travelling wave solutions of the Fisher–Stefan model and often-neglected travelling wave solutions of the Fisher–KPP model. Furthermore, we give closed-form approximate expressions for the shape of the travelling wave solutions of the Fisher–Stefan model in the limit of slow travelling wave speeds,

	abstract = {Pattern formation in biological tissues plays an important role in the development of living organisms. Since the classical work of Alan Turing, a pre-eminent way of modelling has been through reaction-diffusion mechanisms. More recently, alternative models have been proposed, that link dynamics of diffusing molecular signals with tissue mechanics. In order to distinguish among different models, they should be compared to experimental observations. However, in many experimental situations only the limiting, stationary regime of the pattern formation process is observable, without knowledge of the transient behaviour or the initial state. The unstable nature of the underlying dynamics in all alternative models seriously complicates model and parameter identification, since small changes in the initial condition lead to distinct stationary patterns. To overcome this problem the initial state of the model can be randomised. In the latter case, fixed values of the model parameters correspond to a family of patterns rather than a fixed stationary solution, and standard approaches to compare pattern data directly with model outputs, e.g., in the least squares sense, are not suitable. Instead, statistical characteristics of the patterns should be compared, which is difficult given the typically limited amount of available data in practical applications. To deal with this problem, we extend a recently developed statistical approach for parameter identification using pattern data, the so-called Correlation Integral Likelihood (CIL) method. We suggest modifications that allow increasing the accuracy of the identification process without resizing the data set. The proposed approach is tested using different classes of pattern formation models. For all considered equations, parallel GPU-based implementations of the numerical solvers with efficient time stepping schemes are provided.},

              We evaluated the effects of the site of ventricular pacing on left ventricular (LV) synchrony and function in children requiring permanent pacing.
            
            
              Methods and Results—
              
                One hundred seventy-eight children (aged {\textless}18 years) from 21 centers with atrioventricular block and a structurally normal heart undergoing permanent pacing were studied cross-sectionally. Median age at evaluation was 11.2 (interquartile range, 6.3–15.0) years. Median pacing duration was 5.4 (interquartile range, 3.1–8.8) years. Pacing sites were the free wall of the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract (n=8), lateral RV (n=44), RV apex (n=61), RV septum (n=29), LV apex (n=12), LV midlateral wall (n=17), and LV base (n=7). LV synchrony, pump function, and contraction efficiency were significantly affected by pacing site and were superior in children paced at the LV apex/LV midlateral wall. LV dyssynchrony correlated inversely with LV ejection fraction (
                R
                =0.80,
                P
                =0.031). Pacing from the RV outflow tract/lateral RV predicted significantly decreased LV function (LV ejection fraction {\textless}45\%; odds ratio, 10.72; confidence interval, 2.07–55.60;
                P
                =0.005), whereas LV apex/LV midlateral wall pacing was associated with preserved LV function (LV ejection fraction ≥55\%; odds ratio, 8.26; confidence interval, 1.46–47.62;
                P
                =0.018). Presence of maternal autoantibodies, gender, age at implantation, duration of pacing, DDD mode, and QRS duration had no significant impact on LV ejection fraction.
              
            
            
              Conclusions—
              The site of ventricular pacing has a major impact on LV mechanical synchrony, efficiency, and pump function in children who require lifelong pacing. Of the sites studied, LV apex/LV midlateral wall pacing has the greatest potential to prevent pacing-induced reduction of cardiac pump function.},

	abstract = {Cardiac mechanical contraction is triggered by electrical activation via an intracellular calcium-dependent process known as excitation–contraction coupling. Dysregulation of cardiac myocyte intracellular calcium handling is a common feature of heart failure. At the organ scale, electrical dyssynchrony leads to mechanical alterations and exacerbates pump dysfunction in heart failure. A reverse coupling between cardiac mechanics and electrophysiology is also well established. It is commonly referred as cardiac mechanoelectric feedback and thought to be an important contributor to the increased risk of arrhythmia during pathological conditions that alter regional cardiac wall mechanics, including heart failure. At the cellular scale, most investigations of myocyte mechanoelectric feedback have focused on the roles of stretch-activated ion channels, though mechanisms that are independent of ionic currents have also been described. Here we review excitation–contraction coupling and mechanoelectric feedback at the cellular and organ scales, and we identify the need for new multicellular tissue-scale model systems and experiments that can help us to obtain a better understanding of how interactions between electrophysiological and mechanical processes at the cell scale affect ventricular electromechanical interactions at the organ scale in the normal and diseased heart.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in cardiac simulation have rendered the heart the most highly integrated example of a virtual organ. We are on the brink of a revolution in cardiac research, one in which computational modeling of proteins, cells, tissues, and the organ permit linking genomic and proteomic information to the integrated organ behavior, in the quest for a quantitative understanding of the functioning of the heart in health and disease. The goal of this review is to assess the existing state-of-the-art in whole-heart modeling and the plethora of its applications in cardiac research. General whole-heart modeling approaches are presented, and the applications of whole-heart models in cardiac electrophysiology and electromechanics research are reviewed. The article showcases the contributions that whole-heart modeling and simulation have made to our understanding of the functioning of the heart. A summary of the future developments envisioned for the field of cardiac simulation and modeling is also presented. Biophysically based computational modeling of the heart, applied to human heart physiology and the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease, has the potential to dramatically change 21st century cardiac research and the field of cardiology.},

	abstract = {Objective
              The crypt population in the human intestine is dynamic: crypts can divide to produce two new daughter crypts through a process termed crypt fission, but whether this is balanced by a second process to remove crypts, as recently shown in mouse models, is uncertain. We examined whether crypt fusion (the process of two neighbouring crypts fusing into a single daughter crypt) occurs in the human colon.
            
            
              Design
              We used somatic alterations in the gene cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) as lineage tracing markers to assess the clonality of bifurcating colon crypts (n=309 bifurcating crypts from 13 patients). Mathematical modelling was used to determine whether the existence of crypt fusion can explain the experimental data, and how the process of fusion influences the rate of crypt fission.
            
            
              Results
              
                In 55\% (21/38) of bifurcating crypts in which clonality could be assessed, we observed perfect segregation of clonal lineages to the respective crypt arms. Mathematical modelling showed that this frequency of perfect segregation could not be explained by fission alone (p{\textless}10
                −20
                ). With the rates of fission and fusion taken to be approximately equal, we then used the distribution of CCO-deficient patch size to estimate the rate of crypt fission, finding a value of around 0.011 divisions/crypt/year.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              We have provided the evidence that human colonic crypts undergo fusion, a potential homeostatic process to regulate total crypt number. The existence of crypt fusion in the human colon adds a new facet to our understanding of the highly dynamic and plastic phenotype of the colonic epithelium.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Wide tumour excision is currently the standard approach to surgical treatment of solid cancers including carcinomas of the lower genital tract. This strategy is based on the premise that tumours exhibit isotropic growth potential. We reviewed and analysed local tumour spreading patterns in 518 patients with cancer of the uterine cervix who underwent surgical tumour resection. Based on data obtained from pathological examination of the surgical specimen, we applied computational modelling techniques to simulate local tumour spread in order to identify parameters influencing preferred infiltration patterns and used area-proportional Euler diagrams to detect and confirm ordered patterns of tumour spread. Some anatomical structures, e.g. tissues of the urinary bladder, were significantly more likely to be infiltrated than other structures, e.g. the ureter and the rectum. Computational models assuming isotropic growth could not explain these infiltration patterns. Introducing ontogenetic distance of a tissue relative to the uterine cervix as a parameter led to accurate predictions of the clinically observed infiltration likelihoods. The clinical data indicates that successive infiltration likelihoods of ontogenetically distant tissues are nearly perfect subsets of ontogenetically closer tissues. The prevailing assumption of isotropic tumour extension has significant shortcomings in the case of cervical cancer. Rather, cervical cancer spread seems to follow ontogenetically defined trajectories.},

We also discuss innovative, cutting-edge modeling methods that are moving predictive multiscale cancer modeling toward clinical application.

	abstract = {The dynamics of tumor growth and associated events cover multiple time and spatial scales, generally including extracellular, cellular and intracellular modifications. The main goal of this study is to model the biological and physical behavior of tumor evolution in presence of normal healthy tissue, considering a variety of events involved in the process. These include hyper and hypoactivation of signaling pathways during tumor growth, vessels’ growth, intratumoral vascularization and competition of cancer cells with healthy host tissue. The work addresses two distinctive phases in tumor development—the avascular and vascular phases—and in each stage two cases are considered—with and without normal healthy cells. The tumor growth rate increases considerably as closed vessel loops (anastomoses) form around the tumor cells resulting from tumor induced vascularization. When taking into account the host tissue around the tumor, the results show that competition between normal cells and cancer cells leads to the formation of a hypoxic tumor core within a relatively short period of time. Moreover, a dense intratumoral vascular network is formed throughout the entire lesion as a sign of a high malignancy grade, which is consistent with reported experimental data for several types of solid carcinomas. In comparison with other mathematical models of tumor development, in this work we introduce a multiscale simulation that models the cellular interactions and cell behavior as a consequence of the activation of oncogenes and deactivation of gene signaling pathways within each cell. Simulating a therapy that blocks relevant signaling pathways results in the prevention of further tumor growth and leads to an expressive decrease in its size (82\% in the simulation).},

              No prior study has examined the effects of air pollution on the progression from healthy to chronic lung disease, subsequent chronic lung multimorbidity and further to death.
            
            
              Methods
              We used data from the UK Biobank of 265 506 adults free of chronic lung disease at recruitment. Chronic lung multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of at least two chronic lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. The concentrations of air pollutants were estimated using land-use regression models. Multistate models were applied to assess the effect of air pollution on the progression of chronic lung multimorbidity.
            
            
              Results
              
                During a median follow-up of 11.9 years, 13 863 participants developed at least one chronic lung disease, 1055 developed chronic lung multimorbidity and 12 772 died. We observed differential associations of air pollution with different trajectories of chronic lung multimorbidity. Fine particulate matter showed the strongest association with all five transitions, with HRs (95\% CI) per 5 µg/m
                3
                increase of 1.31 (1.22 to 1.42) and 1.27 (1.01 to 1.57) for transitions from healthy to incident chronic lung disease and from incident chronic lung disease to chronic lung multimorbidity, and 1.32 (1.21 to 1.45), 1.24 (1.01 to 1.53) and 1.91 (1.14 to 3.20) for mortality risk from healthy, incident chronic lung disease and chronic lung multimorbidity, respectively.

              in silico
              are termed virtual heart technologies. When anatomy and EP are tailored to individual patients within the model, such technologies are promising clinical and industrial tools. Regardless of their vast potential, few virtual technologies simulating the entire organ-scale EP of all four-chambers of the heart have been reported and widespread clinical use is limited due to high computational costs and difficulty in validation. We thus report on the development of a novel virtual technology representing the electrophysiology of all four-chambers of the heart aiming to overcome these limitations. In our previous work, a model of ventricular EP embedded in a torso was constructed from clinical magnetic resonance image (MRI) data and personalized according to the measured 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) of a single subject under normal sinus rhythm. This model is then expanded upon to include whole heart EP and a detailed representation of the His-Purkinje system (HPS). To test the capacities of the personalized virtual heart technology to replicate standard clinical morphological ECG features under such conditions, bundle branch blocks within both the right and the left ventricles under two different conduction velocity settings are modeled alongside sinus rhythm. To ensure clinical viability, model generation was completely automated and simulations were performed using an efficient real-time cardiac EP simulator. Close correspondence between the measured and simulated 12 lead ECG was observed under normal sinus conditions and all simulated bundle branch blocks manifested relevant clinical morphological features.},

            Providing therapies tailored to each patient is the vision of precision medicine, enabled by the increasing ability to capture extensive data about individual patients. In this position paper, we argue that the second enabling pillar towards this vision is the increasing power of computers and algorithms to learn, reason, and build the ‘digital twin’ of a patient. Computational models are boosting the capacity to draw diagnosis and prognosis, and future treatments will be tailored not only to current health status and data, but also to an accurate projection of the pathways to restore health by model predictions. The early steps of the digital twin in the area of cardiovascular medicine are reviewed in this article, together with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We emphasize the synergies between mechanistic and statistical models in accelerating cardiovascular research and enabling the vision of precision medicine.},

              This executive summary of the clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to assess and diagnose chest pain in adult patients.
            
            
              Methods:
              A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered.
            
            
              Structure:
              Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The “2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain” provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. These guidelines present an evidence-based approach to risk stratification and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.},

	abstract = {The ECG is one of the most commonly used non-invasive tools to gain insights into the electrical functioning of the heart. It has been crucial as a foundation in the creation and validation of
              in silico
              models describing the underlying electrophysiological processes. However, so far, the contraction of the heart and its influences on the ECG have mainly been overlooked in
              in silico
              models. As the heart contracts and moves, so do the electrical sources within the heart responsible for the signal on the body surface, thus potentially altering the ECG. To illuminate these aspects, we developed a human 4-chamber electro-mechanically coupled whole heart
              in silico
              model and embedded it within a torso model. Our model faithfully reproduces measured 12-lead ECG traces, circulatory characteristics, as well as physiological ventricular rotation and atrioventricular valve plane displacement. We compare our dynamic model to three non-deforming ones in terms of standard clinically used ECG leads (Einthoven and Wilson) and body surface potential maps (BSPM). The non-deforming models consider the heart at its ventricular end-diastatic, end-diastolic and end-systolic states. The standard leads show negligible differences during P-Wave and QRS-Complex, yet during T-Wave the leads closest to the heart show prominent differences in amplitude. When looking at the BSPM, there are no notable differences during the P-Wave, but effects of cardiac motion can be observed already during the QRS-Complex, increasing further during the T-Wave. We conclude that for the modeling of activation (P-Wave/QRS-Complex), the associated effort of simulating a complete electro-mechanical approach is not worth the computational cost. But when looking at ventricular repolarization (T-Wave) in standard leads as well as BSPM, there are areas where the signal can be influenced by cardiac motion of the heart to an extent that should not be ignored.},

	abstract = {Numerous electrocardiographic criteria, which are largely dependent on fixed voltage thresholds, have been proposed for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Electrocardiographic criteria for LVH were examined in 4,684 subjects of the Framingham Heart Study who underwent echocardiographic study for LVH. Echocardiographic LVH was detected in 290 men (14.2\%) and 465 women (17.6\%). Electrocardiographic features of LVH were present in 2.9\% of men (60/2,042) and 1.5\% of women (39/2,642). The overall sensitivity of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of LVH was 6.9\%, whereas specificity was 98.8\%. Sensitivity of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for LVH was marginally lower in women than in men (5.6\% vs. 9.0\%, p = 0.075). Obesity was inversely associated with sensitivity (p less than 0.05, both sexes combined, sex-adjusted). Smoking was also inversely related to sensitivity (p = 0.001, both sexes combined, sex-adjusted). In contrast, sensitivity of the ECG increased with age (p less than 0.001, both sexes combined, sex-adjusted). These findings suggest that electrocardiographic detection of LVH can be improved by incorporating information about noncardiac factors that impact on electrocardiographic sensitivity for LVH, presumably by attenuating QRS voltage. New strategies that take into consideration sex, age, smoking status, and obesity might improve the sensitivity of the ECG without diminishing specificity.},

The increase in myocardial mass lowers coronary reserve and enhances cardiac oxygen requirements, gives rise to ventricular ectopy, and impairs left-ventricular filling and contractility. Besides hypertension, other risk factors such as obesity, advanced age, valvular heart disease, and other pathologic disorders can cause an increase in the hemodynamic burden and lead to LVH. Nonhemodynamic determinants of left-ventricular mass include dietary salt intake, alcohol, and neurohormones. LVH and its sequelae can be reduced by specific antihypertensive therapy, but despite these promising findings, future epidemiologic studies are necessary to document the clinical benefits of a reduction in LVH.},

              Background
              
                Doubts remain over the use of the ECG in identifying those with increased left ventricular (LV) mass. This is especially so in young individuals, despite their high prevalence of ECG criteria for LV hypertrophy. We performed a study using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), which provides an
                in vivo
                non-invasive gold standard method of measuring LV mass, allowing accurate assessment of electrocardiography as a tool for defining LV hypertrophy in the young.
              
            
            
              Methods and results
              
                Standard 12-lead ECGs were obtained from 101 Caucasian male army recruits aged (mean ± SEM) 19.7 ± 0.2 years. LV mass was measured using CMR. LV mass indexed to body surface area demonstrated no significant correlation with the Cornell Amplitude criteria or Cornell Product for LV hypertrophy. Moderate correlations were seen with the Sokolow-Lyon Amplitude (0.28) and Sokolow-Lyon Product (0.284). Defining LV hypertrophy as a body surface area indexed left ventricular mass of 93 g/m
                2
                , calculated sensitivities [and specificities] were as follows; 38.7\% [74.3\%] for the Sokolow-Lyon criteria, 43.4\% [61.4\%] for the Sokolow-Lyon Product, 19.4\% [91.4\%] for Cornell Amplitude, and 22.6\% [85.7\%] for Cornell Product. These values are substantially less than those reported for older age groups.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              ECG criteria for LV hypertrophy may have little value in determining LV mass or the presence of LV hypertrophy in young fit males.},

            Personalized models of cardiac electrophysiology (EP) that match clinical observation with high fidelity, referred to as cardiac digital twins (CDTs), show promise as a tool for tailoring cardiac precision therapies. Building CDTs of cardiac EP relies on the ability of models to replicate the ventricular activation sequence under a broad range of conditions. Of pivotal importance is the His–Purkinje system (HPS) within the ventricles. Workflows for the generation and incorporation of HPS models are needed for use in cardiac digital twinning pipelines that aim to minimize the misfit between model predictions and clinical data such as the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We thus develop an automated two stage approach for HPS personalization. A fascicular-based model is first introduced that modulates the endocardial Purkinje network. Only emergent features of sites of earliest activation within the ventricular myocardium and a fast-conducting sub-endocardial layer are accounted for. It is then replaced by a topologically realistic Purkinje-based representation of the HPS. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Equivalence between both HPS model representations is investigated by comparing activation patterns and 12 lead ECGs under both sinus rhythm and right-ventricular apical pacing. Predominant ECG morphology is preserved by both HPS models under sinus conditions, but elucidates differences during pacing.},

	abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram was invented more than 100 years ago and is still used as an essential tool in the early detection of heart disease. By estimating the time-varying source of the electrical activity from the potential changes, several types of heart disease can be noninvasively identified. However, most previous studies are based on signal processing, and thus an approach that includes physics modeling would be helpful for source localization problems. This study proposes a localization method for cardiac sources by combining an electrical analysis with a volume conductor model of the human body as a forward problem and a sparse reconstruction method as an inverse problem. Our formulation estimates not only the current source location but also the current direction. For a 12-lead electrocardiogram system, a sensitivity analysis of the localization to cardiac volume, tilted angle, and model inhomogeneity was evaluated. Finally, the estimated source location is corrected by Kalman filter, considering the estimated electrocardiogram source as time-sequence data. For a high signal-to-noise ratio (greater than 20 dB), the dominant error sources were the model inhomogeneity, which is mainly attributable to the high conductivity of the blood in the heart. The average localization error of the electric dipole sources in the heart was 12.6 mm, which is comparable to that in previous studies, where a less detailed anatomical structure was considered. A time-series source localization with Kalman filtering indicated that source mislocalization could be compensated, suggesting the effectiveness of the source estimation using the current direction and location simultaneously. For the electrocardiogram R-wave, the mean distance error was reduced to less than 7.3 mm using the proposed method. Considering the physical properties of the human body with Kalman filtering enables highly accurate estimation of the cardiac electric signal source location and direction. This proposal is also applicable to electrode configuration, such as ECG sensing systems.},

                A few studies have recently reported clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of
                QRS
                transition zone as predictors of mortality. However, their prospective correlates and associations with individual cardiovascular disease (
                CVD
                ) outcomes are yet to be investigated.
              
            
            
              Methods and Results
              
                Among 13 567
                ARIC
                (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants aged 45 to 64 years, we studied key correlates of changes in the status of clockwise and counterclockwise rotation over time as well as the association of rotation status with incidence of coronary heart disease (2408 events), heart failure (2196 events), stroke (991 events), composite
                CVD
                (4124 events), 898
                CVD
                deaths, and 3469 non‐
                CVD
                deaths over 23 years of follow‐up. At baseline, counterclockwise rotation was most prevalent (52.9\%), followed by no (40.5\%) and clockwise (6.6\%) rotation. Of patients with no rotation, 57.9\% experienced counterclockwise or clockwise rotation during follow‐up, with diabetes mellitus and black race significantly predicting clockwise and counterclockwise conversion, respectively. Clockwise rotation was significantly associated with higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.41) and non‐
                CVD
                death (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.12–1.46) after adjusting for potential confounders including other ECG parameters. On the contrary, counterclockwise rotation was significantly related to lower risk of composite
                CVD
                (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.87–0.99]),
                CVD
                mortality (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.65–0.88), and non‐
                CVD
                deaths (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.85–0.99 [borderline significance with heart failure]).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Counterclockwise rotation, the most prevalent
                QRS

	abstract = {Widely developed for clinical screening, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings capture the cardiac electrical activity from the body surface. ECG analysis can therefore be a crucial first step to help diagnose, understand and predict cardiovascular disorders responsible for 30\% of deaths worldwide. Computational techniques, and more specifically machine learning techniques and computational modelling are powerful tools for classification, clustering and simulation, and they have recently been applied to address the analysis of medical data, especially ECG data. This review describes the computational methods in use for ECG analysis, with a focus on machine learning and 3D computer simulations, as well as their accuracy, clinical implications and contributions to medical advances. The first section focuses on heartbeat classification and the techniques developed to extract and classify abnormal from regular beats. The second section focuses on patient diagnosis from whole recordings, applied to different diseases. The third section presents real-time diagnosis and applications to wearable devices. The fourth section highlights the recent field of personalized ECG computer simulations and their interpretation. Finally, the discussion section outlines the challenges of ECG analysis and provides a critical assessment of the methods presented. The computational methods reported in this review are a strong asset for medical discoveries and their translation to the clinical world may lead to promising advances.},

A combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and quantitative imaging suggested that only a small proportion of Wnt8 ligands diffuses freely, whereas most Wnt8 molecules are bound to cell surfaces. Fluorescence decay after photoconversion showed that Wnt8 ligands bound on cell surfaces decrease exponentially, suggesting a dynamic exchange of bound forms of Wnt ligands. Mathematical modeling based on this exchange recapitulates a graded distribution of bound, but not free, Wnt ligands. Based on these results, we propose that Wnt distribution in tissues is controlled by a dynamic exchange of its abundant bound and rare free populations.},

The four parameters had different values for Dpp versus Wg. In addition, Dynamin-dependent endocytosis was required for spreading of Dpp, but not Wg. Thus, the cellular mechanisms of Dpp and Wingless spreading are different: Dpp spreading requires endocytic, intracellular trafficking.},

	abstract = {Ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be one cause of sudden cardiac death affecting 4.25 million persons per year worldwide. A curative treatment is catheter ablation in order to inactivate the abnormally triggering regions. To facilitate and expedite the localization during the ablation procedure, we present two novel localization techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to existing methods, e.g. using ECG imaging, our approaches were designed to be independent of the patient-specific geometries and directly applicable to surface ECG signals, while also delivering a binary transmural position. One method outputs ranked alternative solutions. Results can be visualized either on a generic or patient geometry. The CNNs were trained on a data set containing only simulated data and evaluated both on simulated and clinical test data. On simulated data, the median test error was below 3mm. The median localization error on the clinical data was as low as 32mm. The transmural position was correctly detected in up to 82\% of all clinical cases. Using the ranked alternative solutions, the top-3 median error dropped to 20mm on clinical data. These results demonstrate a proof of principle to utilize CNNs to localize the activation source without the intrinsic need of patient-specific geometrical information. Furthermore, delivering multiple solutions can help the physician to find the real activation source amongst more than one possible locations. With further optimization, these methods have a high potential to speed up clinical interventions. Consequently they could decrease procedural risk and improve VT patients' outcomes.},

	abstract = {The numerical modeling of cardiac electrophysiology has reached a mature and advanced state that allows for quantitative modeling of many clinically relevant processes. As a result, complex computational tasks such as the creation of a variety of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from virtual cohorts of models representing biological variation are within reach. This requires a correct representation of the variability of a population by suitable distributions of a number of input parameters. Hence, the assessment of the dependence and variation of model outputs by sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification become crucial. Since the standard metrological approach of using Monte–Carlo simulations is computationally prohibitive, we use a nonintrusive polynomial chaos-based approximation of the forward model used for obtaining the atrial contribution to a realistic electrocardiogram. The surrogate increases the speed of computations for varying parameters by orders of magnitude and thereby greatly enhances the versatility of uncertainty quantification. It further allows for the quantification of parameter influences via Sobol indices for the time series of 12 lead ECGs and provides bounds for the accuracy of the obtained sensitivities derived from an estimation of the surrogate approximation error. Thus, it is capable of supporting and improving the creation of synthetic databases of ECGs from a virtual cohort mapping a representative sample of the human population based on physiologically and anatomically realistic three-dimensional models.},

            An adaptive BDF2 implicit time-stepping method is analyzed for the phase field crystal model. The suggested method is proved to preserve a modified energy dissipation law at the discrete levels when the time-step ratios satisfy \$r\_k:={\textbackslash}tau \_k/{\textbackslash}tau \_\{k-1\}\&lt;3.561\$, which is the zero-stability restriction of the variable-step BDF2 scheme for ordinary differential equations. With the help of discrete orthogonal convolution kernels and corresponding convolution inequalities, an optimal \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ norm error estimate is established under the weak step-ratio restriction \$0\&lt;r\_k\&lt;3.561\$ to ensure energy stability. As far as we know, this is the first time that such an error estimate is theoretically proved for a nonlinear parabolic equation. Based on tests on random temporal meshes an effective adaptive time-stepping strategy is suggested to efficiently capture the multi-scale behavior and accelerate the numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {A new family of time integration algorithms is presented for solving structural dynamics problems. The new method, denoted as the generalized-α method, possesses numerical dissipation that can be controlled by the user. In particular, it is shown that the generalized-α method achieves high-frequency dissipation while minimizing unwanted low-frequency dissipation. Comparisons are given of the generalized-α method with other numerically dissipative time integration methods; these results highlight the improved performance of the new algorithm. The new algorithm can be easily implemented into programs that already include the Newmark and Hilber-Hughes-Taylor-α time integration methods.},

Discussion focuses on a number of aspects of flexible multibody dynamics including: modeling of the flexible components, constraint modeling, solution techniques, control strategies, coupled problems, design, and experimental studies. The characteristics of the three types of reference frames used in modeling flexible multibody systems, namely, floating frame, corotational frame, and inertial frame, are compared. Future directions of research are identified. These include new applications such as micro- and nano-mechanical systems; techniques and strategies for increasing the fidelity and computational efficiency of the models; and tools that can improve the design process of flexible multibody systems. This review article cites 877 references.},

	abstract = {Faults in HVAC systems degrade thermal comfort and energy efficiency in buildings and have received significant attention from the research community, with data driven methods gaining in popularity. Yet the lack of labeled data, such as normal versus faulty operational status, has slowed the application of machine learning to HVAC systems. In addition, for any particular building, there may be an insufficient number of observed faults over a reasonable amount of time for training. To overcome these challenges, we present a transfer methodology for a novel Bayesian classifier designed to distinguish between normal operations and faulty operations. The key is to train this classifier on a building with a large amount of sensor and fault data (for example, via simulation or standard test data) then transfer the classifier to a new building using a small amount of normal operations data from the new building. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept for transferring a classifier between architecturally similar buildings in different climates and show few samples are required to maintain classification precision and recall.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper aims to present a finite element formulation to approximate systems of reaction–diffusion–advection equations, focusing on cases with nonlinear reaction. The formulation is based on the orthogonal sub-grid scale approach, with some simplifications that allow one to stabilize only the convective term, which is the source of potential instabilities. The space approximation is combined with finite difference time integration and a Newton–Raphson linearization of the reactive term. Some numerical examples show the accuracy of the resulting formulation. Applications using classical nonlinear reaction models in population dynamics are also provided, showing the robustness of the approach proposed.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A stabilized finite element method for advection–diffusion–reaction equations to the problem on nonlinear reaction is adapted. The formulation designed has been implemented in a computer code. Numerical examples are run to show the accuracy and robustness of the formulation.
            
            
              Findings
              The stabilized finite element method from which the authors depart can be adapted to problems with nonlinear reaction. The resulting method is very robust and accurate. The framework developed is applicable to several problems of interest by themselves, such as the predator–prey model.
            
            
              Originality/value
              A stabilized finite element method to problems with nonlinear reaction has been extended. Original contributions are the design of the stabilization parameters and the linearization of the problem. The application examples, apart from demonstrating the validity of the numerical model, help to get insight in the system of nonlinear equations being solved.},

            Motivation: The simulation of morphogenetic problems requires the simultaneous and coupled simulation of signalling and tissue dynamics. A cellular resolution of the tissue domain is important to adequately describe the impact of cell-based events, such as cell division, cell–cell interactions and spatially restricted signalling events. A tightly coupled cell-based mechano-regulatory simulation tool is therefore required.
            Results: We developed an open-source software framework for morphogenetic problems. The environment offers core functionalities for the tissue and signalling models. In addition, the software offers great flexibility to add custom extensions and biologically motivated processes. Cells are represented as highly resolved, massless elastic polygons; the viscous properties of the tissue are modelled by a Newtonian fluid. The Immersed Boundary method is used to model the interaction between the viscous and elastic properties of the cells, thus extending on the IBCell model. The fluid and signalling processes are solved using the Lattice Boltzmann method. As application examples we simulate signalling-dependent tissue dynamics.

In the models, we focus on three key variables implicated in the invasion process, namely, tumour cells, host tissue (extracellular matrix) and matrix-degradative enzymes associated with the tumour cells. The first model focusses on the macro-scale structure (cell population level) and considers the tumour as a single mass. The mathematical model consists of a system of partial differential equations describing the production and/or activation of degradative enzymes by the tumour cells, the degradation of the matrix and the migratory response of the tumour cells. Numerical simulations are presented in one and two space dimensions and compared qualitatively with experimental and clinical observations. The second type of model focusses on the micro-scale (individual cell) level and uses a discrete technique developed in previous models of angiogenesis. This technique enables one to model migration and invasion at the level of individual cells and hence it is possible to examine the implications of metastatic spread. Finally, the results of the models are compared with actual clinical observations and the implications of the model for improved surgical treatment of patients are considered.},
